There are few people in the data space that wouldn’t have heard the noise Snowflake is making. For those who haven’t heard Snowflake is a Cloud based Data Warehousing solution that separates storage and compute to scale with ease.   The Snowflake Data Warehouse is taking the market by storm and gaining more and more traction with its ever-increasing results. 

With more and more customers going towards this new technology it is important to keep in mind that like anything it needs to be monitored in terms of cost, performance and security. It can be easily forgotten when implementing a new tool, the cost implications of running an entire data load or increasing the size of a data warehouse to a 4xl. 

With the understanding that key metrics required to monitor when utilising the power of Snowflake, a Power BI dashboard has been designed to help customers understand the costs, key performance criteria and user interaction.

Power BI, the Microsoft interactive visualisation tool was used to implement these dashboards. The ease of connecting to Snowflake using Power BI was a key driver along with its ability to be used on the Desktop (via Power BI Desktop) free or published to the Power BI Service (requiring a Pro license for sharing of the report). Power BI is fast becoming a market leader in the BI visualisation space and a great add-on with Snowflake. 

The Snowflake Operations Report provides several visualisations to assist in managing the use of Snowflake. The report queries Snowflakes metadata and reports on specific topics and split into the 3 following pages:

Snowflake Usage
The Snowflake Usage report is Powerful page used for operations management to track costs of Snowflake and see any outliers in how the credits are being consumed. The key questions being answered here are:

·        What is my current monthly cost?
·        How is my cost tracking for the year?
·        Where are the credits being consumed (warehouse, times of day, day of week)?


·        What Queries are taking the longest?

·        Which Data Warehouse is executing the most queries?

·        Which Databases are using larger sized Warehouse types?

·        What Query types are taking the longest to run.



The focus of this Dashboard is to:

·        Check if any new users are using the Snowflake (registration is controlled etc)

·        Monitor failed logins – is anyone trying to login to the system who shouldn’t be

·        User related errors – Do any users need assistance in queries
